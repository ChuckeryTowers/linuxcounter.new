                        <p><strong>Dear linux user!</strong></p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Please hold by and read this information carefully, as it contains important things about
                            your private data, your account and the moving and migration.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>First, we want to welcome you to this very new page of the Linux Counter Project!<br/>
                            Presumably, you have reached this page, because you wanted to log in to your account on the
                            old page, or you have read our announcements in the social networks. It is some months ago,
                            since we have announced, that we'll develop a very new page for the Linux Counter Project.
                        </p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Our first try with developing the page with the micro framework "Silex" and containing a cool
                            timeline feature like the one from facebook was a failure.<br/>
                            So we've decided to start again from scratch, using the Symfony 2 framework and as many
                            useful
                            and available third party bundles as possible to improve stability and security, as we
                            didn't want
                            to reinvent the wheel(s).</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>The second reason for again starting from scratch was the responsiveness and mobility of the
                            page. This is much easier and and better integrated in the Symfony 2 Framework, together
                            with
                            the Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>So, well, here we are now and the page is ready to get used. Unfortunately the migration and
                            moving of the whole data from the old database will take some several days, maybe weeks, as
                            the database is really huge with thousands of thousands of data sets which all needs to be
                            converted to the new database format. This is not so easy, but it has to be done.<br/>
                            The migration, moving and converting already has started some few days ago and thus, the
                            login
                            to the old page is now deactivated, in order to prevent data loss.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>All your account, user and machines data already are migrated and converted, so we are now
                            able to allow the login to this new page.<br/>
                            Unfortunately there are some few profiles information that couldn't be migrated, for example
                            your password, as they are encrypted in the database and the new encryption is much more
                            secure.
                            Also the city where you are living was not migrated and a few others.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>So, the first thing you have to do in order to be able to login and to change and complete
                            your data, is to <a href="{{ url('syw_front_main_main_index') }}resetting/request">reset and
                                create your new password</a></p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>After you have created your new password, you will be able to <a
                                    href="{{ url('syw_front_main_main_index') }}login">Login to your account</a> and to
                            change all of your personal data and your machines.
                        </p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Actually there are still some things missing in this new page:
                        <ul>
                            <li>All the statistics about the users, machines, countries, distributions, etc...</li>
                            <li><span class="strikethrough">The ability to change your privacy settings. But don't worry, all your private data is
                                hidden by default.</span> (This is implemented now)</li>
                            <li>The new lico update script for this new page, the old one won't work anymore.</li>
                            <li><span class="strikethrough">The RESTful API, promised on the startpage, is also still missing.</span> (This is implemented now)</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>


                        <p>But be sure that we're doing our best to complete this new page and to add the missing
                            features very, very soon.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Some short words about the <strong>update script</strong>:</p>
                        <p>The actual update script, that one which was downloadable from the old page, <strong>still
                                works</strong>. But it will NOT update the data on the new page! It only updates the
                            data on the old page and thus, updates will not be reflected or migrated to the new page.
                            The nifty signature images are also still working.<br/>
                        As soon as the new page will move to the main domain and finally completely replace the old page,
                            there will be a new update script available. The signature images should then continue to
                            work, but the look and design of these images will maybe change.</p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>One thing about the development itself: We are always talking in the "we" and "our" format, but
                            actually only one person is developing, maintaining and leading this project: Alexander LÃ¶hner</p>
                        <p>I, Alex, would be very, very glad about some help! So, the new page is developed through <a href="https://github.com/alexloehner/linuxcounter.new">github</a>.
                            It would be really cool, if you would <a href="https://github.com/alexloehner/linuxcounter.new">fork the project</a> and submit pull requests, if you have something developed or fixed.</p>
                        <p>If you really want to help me with this project and you're dreaming in php classes and methods, please contact me and I would be glad to welcome you in my team and give you direct access to the repository. </p>
                        <p> &nbsp; </p>

                        <p>So, the last thing to mention is, that we would be very, very glad about EVERY feature
                            request, reported issue or bug and also about every compliment or praise you want to tell

                            The New <em>LinuxCounter Project</em> was created in order to revive and replace the good old linux counter project on <a href="http://counter.li.org" title="Link to the old counter project">counter.li.org</a>.<br>
                            Since January 11, 2012 counter.li.org redirects directly to linuxcounter.net and thus, linuxcounter.net is the only and main real linux counter with the greatest userbase.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The original <em>Linux Counter</em> was run by a nonprofit membership organization called the <em>Linux Counter</em> Project. This organization was created on May 1, 1999, taking over the running of the counter from Harald Tveit Alvestrand, who has been running the project since 1993. Harald Alvestrand is chief executive officer of the organization.<br>
                            <br>It was started as a "for fun" project to find out how many Linux users there are worldwide. The basic idea is for people to register themselves as being a Linux user. Of course, this way you won't get all Linux users counted as not every Linux user will register himself at the <em>Linux Counter</em> site. Thus, the only way to "know" the number of Linux users worldwide, is to make a guess, preferably a not-too-wild guess of the number of Linux users. Not making wild guesses there is only one way to go: <b>statistics</b>. And so, there we are.<br>
