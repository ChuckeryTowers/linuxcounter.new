Description
-----------

The LinuxCounter Project was created in order to revive and replace the good old linux counter project on counter.li.org.
Since January 11, 2012 counter.li.org redirects directly to linuxcounter.net and thus, linuxcounter.net is the only and main real linux counter with the greatest userbase.

The original Linux Counter was run by a nonprofit membership organization called the Linux Counter Project. This organization was created on May 1, 1999, taking over the running of the counter from Harald Tveit Alvestrand, who has been running the project since 1993. Harald Alvestrand is chief executive officer of the organization.

It was started as a "for fun" project to find out how many Linux users there are worldwide. The basic idea is for people to register themselves as being a Linux user. Of course, this way you won't get all Linux users counted as not every Linux user will register himself at the Linux Counter site. Thus, the only way to "know" the number of Linux users worldwide, is to make a guess, preferably a not-too-wild guess of the number of Linux users. Not making wild guesses there is only one way to go: statistics. And so, there we are.

Also see this wikipedia article (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Counter) for information about the Linux Counter Project. On the 10th of september in 2011, we also were "slashdotted" (http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/09/10/1249257/the-linux-counter-relaunches).
