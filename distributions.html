Android is Linux without any GNU.  Google backs Android, which can be found
in the wild in phones, tablets and other devices.  These devices usually
contain proprietary software, and some of the available apps are
proprietary as well.  Android was first announced November 5, 2007.
Android 1.5 (Cupcake) was released April 30, 2009.  Android 4.0 (Ice Cream
Sandwich) is still running in some devices.  Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean)
preview was released June 27, 2012.  Jelly Bean source code was released
July 9, 2012.  Jelly Bean 4.2 started shipping on Google Nexus devices
November 13, 2012; the SDK platform also became available.  Android 4.4

  The Debian Project is one of the oldest distributions and is currently
  the largest volunteer based distribution provider.  The distribution
  supports many languages and hardware platforms, for example the lenny
  release supported i386, amd64, powerpc, alpha, arm, arm64, hppa, ia64,
  mips/mipsel, sparc and s390.  The project also supports more than the
  Linux kernel with variants for kfreebsd and the GNU Hurd.  Debian users
  who want a more current desktop distribution are encouraged to use the
  testing branch, which is where the next stable release (currently
  codenamed Jessie aka 8.0) is prepared and which should normally be quite
  stable.  The names of Debian 9 and 10 will be Stretch and Buster.  Debian
  Developers and users who want to live on the bleeding edge can run the
  unstable branch (Sid) or even try packages from experimental.  The old
  stable version is Debian 6.0 "squeeze", released February 6, 2011.
  Debian GNU/kFreeBSD was introduced as a "technology preview" along with
  squeeze.  Squeeze will receive long term support, until February 6, 2016.
  Debian 6.0.10 was released July 19, 2014, the last release before the LTS
  team took over maintenance.  Debian 7.0 "wheezy" was released May 4,
  2013.  The eighth "wheezy" point release, version 7.8, was released

  of unmodified mainline Linux kernel sources from kernel.org compiled with
  Debian build system plus Ubuntu specific configuration files. Every group
  of configuration files creates a unique combination of build-time defined
  kernel variables. These variables set kernel parameters as target
  processor, memory capabilities, I/O scheduler strategies, process

  stands for A Linux Powered Integrated Network Engine.  Gentoo-based
  Alpine can boot from floppy/usb/cf/cd/whatever, packages are pulled into
  RAM, and everything runs from RAM, just like the distributions found in
  LEAF.  This makes for very fast application load times, and provides
  added security if the boot media is write-protected or removed.  Alpine

  Tin Hat is a Linux distribution derived from hardened Gentoo which aims

  into tmpfs upon booting. One pays the prices of long boot times (5
  minutes off CD, 2 minutes off pen drives), but the advantage afterwords
  is that there are no delays going back to the CD when starting

  NixOS is a Linux distribution based on Nix, a purely functional package
  management system.  NixOS is an experiment to see if an operating system
  can be built in which software packages, configuration files, boot
  scripts and the like are all managed in a purely functional way.  That
  is, they are all built by deterministic functions and they never change
  after they have been built.  NixOS is continuously built from source in
  Hydra, the Nix-based continuous build system.  Entry added May 26, 2009.
  In January 2013 NixOS switched from Upstart to systemd.  Nix 1.5.2 was
  released May 13, 2013.  NixOS 14.12 "Caterpillar" was released December
  30, 2014.

  The NSLU2-Linux project exists to discuss, develop and modify the
  firmware and hardware of the Linksys NSLU2, the Synology DS101, the
  Iomega NAS100d, the D-Link DSMG600, and other ixp4xx-based devices with
  large attached storage.  SlugOS is the collective name for a group of
  firmware distributions which are derived from a common source base (and
  therefore share common documentation as a result of that). OpenSlug uses
  the OpenEmbedded package repository, and is designed for use with an
  external disk.  UcSlugC also uses the OpenEmbedded package repository,
  but is designed to be the basis of some other application-specific
  firmware distribution, rather than a firmware distribution in its own
  right.  SlugOS/LE (formerly known as DebianSlug) uses the Debian package
  repository and is an alternative for those people who want to run Debian
  on their NSLU2.  SlugOS 5.3 beta was released March 2009.

  that will let you set up a high performance computing cluster in a few

  frontend node as the server. All of the nodes of the cluster get their
  filesystems from the same CD image, so it is guaranteed that all nodes
  run the the same software. The CD image is created by running a single
  script, which takes advantage of the Debian Live infrastructure. If you
  need to add packages, it is very easy to create a custom version by
  adding the package names to the script and then running it.  Pelican v1.0

  project. Unlike a standard linux install, Porteus exists in a compressed

  the portable device itself, rather this is created on the fly during the
  boot process, which only takes around 20-30 seconds on a relatively new
  computer. It is modular in design which means extra software comes in the
  form of  'modules' which can be activated and injected into the live file
  system. It does not need to be installed and uninstalled as you may
  expect with other operating systems which takes numerous amounts of
  clicks and agreements.  Porteus joined the list with the release of

  MintPPC is a Linux distribution for 32-bit PowerPC computers.  It is
  based on Linux Mint LXDE, ported to Debian/PPC.  The idea behind MintPPC
  is to have a fast good looking lightweight desktop manager, which runs
  well on older G3 and G4 machines.  MintPPC is for desktop users who want
  a very fast system without the need to install software themselves.  It
  is easy to use and it is complete.  An advantage of this distribution for
  PowerPC users is that a few bugs, which are always present in
  Debian/Ubuntu, have been overcome.  After installing MintPPC things like
  battery status meter, laptop sleep mode and sound will work out of the
  box.  MintPPC is not affiliated with Linux Mint but it uses the same
  underlying source code.  MintPPC was first released as Linux Mint LXDE
  Debian Lenny in May 2010.  MintPPC joined the list with the release of
  MintPPC 9 (released October 31, 2010), which was based on Linux Mint LXDE
